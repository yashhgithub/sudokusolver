This code defines a SudokuSolver class with the following methods:

main: This method creates a sample Sudoku board, calls the solve method to attempt solving it, and prints the solved board or a message indicating no solution was found.
solve: This recursive method iterates through the board cells. If a cell is empty (value 0), it tries placing numbers 1 to 9. For each number, it checks if it's a valid placement using the isValidPlacement method. If a valid placement is found and the recursive call to solve on the remaining board returns true (meaning the board is solved), it returns true. Otherwise, it backtracks by setting the cell back to 0 and tries the next number. If none of the numbers work for the cell, it returns false
